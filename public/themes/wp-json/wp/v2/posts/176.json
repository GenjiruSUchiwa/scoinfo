PACT aims to strengthen capacity to test for COVID-19 across Africa, with emphasis on countries that have only minimal capacity.<\/p>\n<p>This will ensure that at least 10 million Africans, who would have not been tested, get tested in the next six months. PACT will help meet the need of the Heads of State and Government for an Africa-led and Africa-owned response.<\/p>\n<div id='gallery-1' class='gallery galleryid-176 gallery-columns-2 gallery-size-medium'><figure class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<div class='gallery-icon landscape'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https:\/\/scoinfo.org\/chemlabs-46\/'><img width=\"570\" height=\"570\" src=\"https:\/\/scoinfo.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/chemlabs-46-570x570.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/scoinfo.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/chemlabs-46-570x570.jpg 570w, https:\/\/scoinfo.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/chemlabs-46-80x80.jpg 80w, https:\/\/scoinfo.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/chemlabs-46-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/scoinfo.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/chemlabs-46-100x100.jpg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\" \/><\/a>\n\t\t\t<\/div><\/figure><figure class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<div class='gallery-icon '>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https:\/\/scoinfo.org\/chemlabs-13\/'><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https:\/\/scoinfo.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/chemlabs-13.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a>\n\t\t\t<\/div><\/figure>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\n<p>\u201cAs businesses, we are nothing without a healthy and productive workforce.
